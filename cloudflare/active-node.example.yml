# CloudFlare Active Node Configuration
# This file defines which HA node currently receives traffic via DNS
#
# Usage:
# - Update 'active_node' to failover traffic to a different node
# - The cloudflare-dns workflow reads this file to determine the target IP
# - For emergency failover, use the cloudflare-failover workflow instead

# Current active node for DNS routing
# CUSTOMIZE: Set to your preferred default node
active_node: ha01

# External (public) IP addresses for each HA node
# CUSTOMIZE: Replace with your actual public IP addresses
# These IPs are used for DNS A records
external_ips:
  # RFC 5737 example IPs - replace with your actual IPs
  ha01: "192.0.2.11"    # Example IP - replace with actual
  ha02: "192.0.2.12"    # Example IP - replace with actual
  ha03: "192.0.2.13"    # Example IP - replace with actual
